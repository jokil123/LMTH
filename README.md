# LMHT
Is HTML just not spicy enough for you? Do you feel bored and want to experience something different? Something more, something exhilerating, something with less slashes and more headaches?
LMTH might just be right for you! It's like HTML but instead of closing tags with a backslash you close tags with the opening tag but reversed!

# Example
HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello</p>
    World!
  </body>
</html>
```

LMTH:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document<eltit>
  <daeh>
  <body>
    <p>Hello<q>
    World!
  <ydob>
<lmth>
```
